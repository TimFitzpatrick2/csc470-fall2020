# Target Practice

* Title Screen:
The title screen will use mouse input with left click to select a button. The user will be asked to type their name into the screen so that they can be remember on the history board. There will be one button the title screen which will give the user access to begin the game.
*Details:
Target Practice is an archery shooting game. A Bow and Arrow will shoot arrows at targets. The users will only be given 5 arrows and the users has to hit at least 4 different targets to move to the next level. The accuracy of the user will be kept on a history board. 
The game input will be the arrow keys and space bar. The arrow keys will be used to change the direction of the arrows. The space bar will determine the speed of the arrow. If the user holds down the space bar, they will see an arrowspeed meter on the screen increase showing how much force will be put on the arrow. The more the arrowspeed fills up the more force will be added to the arrow.
The scene of the game takes place next to big mountains. The game will be in 1st person and the user will see the scene of the game, the targets the user is shooting at, and the bow with an arrow. The user will see the arrows being shot toward the target. The user will also know when they have hit the target because a “100 points” sign will fly out of the target. 


*Low Bar:
In my game I at least expect to get a target shooting game that has at least 2 levels. The game should be able to recognize when the target is hit by an arrow. Also, the game should keep a history board of which users’ accuracy. 

*Expectation:
I expect to have an archery game that has a clean title screen with the users’ name. The user will have 5 arrows to shoot at the 4 different targets. If the user misses two shots, then they will have to restart the level. I expect to have at least 3 different levels. The 2nd level will have targets that move at slow speed. The 3rd level will have targets that move both forward and side to side. On each level you will be able to either restart the game or go back to the title screen. 

*High Hopes: 
The game will have a clean title screen. In addition to the targets, each level will have birds flying around worth extra points. The game will also have a timer that will keep track of how long the user takes to complete all three levels. The time will be added to the history board along with the accuracy.


*Timeline: 
By Wednesday the 25th, I plan on having all of the visuals set up along with all prefabs. 
By Monday the 30th, I plan on having most of the code working and the game working with little errors and flaws.
By Wednesday the 2nd, I plan on having the game mostly cleaned up with the ability to be able to turn it in.
By Monday the 7th, I plan on having the game finished with everything looking sharp and clean.
