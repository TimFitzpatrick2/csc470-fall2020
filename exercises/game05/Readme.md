# Utopia
In my game there will be a player that can travel around his own utopia. In the utopia there will be 3 different games that the player can play.
SurferBro: if you hover over top of the surferbro you can try surfing with him.
Andy near the woods: If you hover over any you can play target practice.
Racecar: if you hover over top of the racecar you can try driving on a track.
The idea of the game is a twist off of the game Sim City. The ability to walk around a world and hop into whatever world you would like.
