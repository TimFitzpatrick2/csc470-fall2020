*Above the clouds is a game where the player will spond on a cloud and will have to make it to the rainbow (finish line). The player will use the new sponding clouds to jump on and collect coins.
The coins will be scored and tallied when the player crosses the finish line.
If the player falls off the clouds then they will be responded back ontop of the clouds but once the 3 lives are up the game is over.
The player will use left click to jump from cloud to cloud.
